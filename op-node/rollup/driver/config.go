	// - not adopt a L1 origin that can be included on L1 within the allowed range (rollup.Config.SeqWindowSize)
	// and thus fail to produce a block with anything more than deposits.

	// SequencerFencingCheckEndpoint is an optional endpoint that the sequencer can check when producing a new block to ensure
	// it has the "right" to produce this block. Useful for scenarios where you are running multiple sequencers with an election

	// The sequencer will reach out to this endpoint with an HTTP GET request and should receive a 200.

	// SequencerFencingPostPayloadEndpoint is an optional endpoint that the sequencer can use when producing a new block to store
	// externally the respective execution payload. Useful for scenarios where you are running multiple sequencers with an election
	// protocol and you want to mitigate the risk of forks recovering from an inconsistent state.
	// The sequencer will reach out to this endpoint with an HTTP POST request and should receive a 200.
